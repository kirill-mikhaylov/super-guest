2025 CascadiaJS Hackathon Project.

Participants: Adam Burgh, Kirill Mikhaylov, Steve Nielsen

## Quick start

Open the landing page locally in your browser. From the project root you can:

1. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.
2. Or serve it quickly with Python 3 (recommended) to enable relative routing:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes:
- The email capture form on the page is a frontend placeholder and does not send data to a backend.
- The page is a responsive boilerplate â€” feel free to adapt the styles or add a CSS framework.
